using greyhound; we need to dump the stuff from t6
in-game settings; load xmodels and load xanims
model settings; use global, export images with models, export all lods, NO export images into material folders, export semodel and export maya
anim settings; export direct xanims waw compat (xd)
gdt settings; save a legacy gdt (xd!!)

load in black ops 2 zm town surv;
filter 'dsr'
select all BUT crawl, d2p, vzoom
export selected and close


maya time! we need attach the clip model to the weapon model for both view and world
using SETools and Call of Duty Tools,  TheEnbyWitch/CoDMayaTools and DTZxPorter
drag in the view model's LOD0 semodel and bind file
drag in the view model's clip LOD0 semodel and bind file
expand the Joints (ang j_gun) and Joints1, middlemouse drag tag_clip to the bottom of j_gun
expand the both LOD0s, middlemouse drag all the clip's meshes to the bottom of the gun's
select the tag_clip, hit W, and move the clip to that it fits the gun
delete the mesh that houses the clantag stuff t6 has, its not used in t4

im going to add the scope too, same process as attaching the clip

now to export!
highlight both the joints and the LOD0, then select at the top bar and then Heirarchy
hit Call of Duty tools at the top, xport xmodel, save to and export selected

do the same for world model...

we now got the xmodel_export


now we need to convert the assets
using greyhounds gdt export, move and rename it; into the source_data folder
move the _images folder into model_export, move the xmodel_export for view and world u create too into model_export too
open assman; open the gdt u moved

select xmodel, delete the unused entries
make sure to update the filename for the view model to the xmodel_export u made
and the world model, remove the lods, all dists to 0 except the highlod dist, make it 1000
update the filename for world too

go to materials, you need to find missing filenames for the color maps of the materials, everything should be in the _images folder

now convert all the materials!! we will have the gun in waw model format!!



we can just use the greyhound waw modtools anims, so just move the files (not seanim files) inside ur greyhound dump xanims folder into your raw xanims folder, done!!

for pap model, you could copy the xmodel_export and modify it to '_pap' or something to the materials, and create these materials in assman
